We work with whole genome sequence data to understand how bacterial pathogens colonise humans and, in some cases, cause disease.

By studying the bacteria with high resolution genetic data we aim to understand how bacterial pathogens evolve to evade clinical intervention strategies (eg. antibiotics and vaccines), how they transmit from person to person and how they spread from country to country. Ultimately we hope to generate new knowledge that can be used to improve strategies for infection control and disease prevention.
