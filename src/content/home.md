## ABOUT US (Christine - Ste to refine)

We are interested in using whole genome sequencing techniques to understand how bacterial pathogens colonise various animals and humans, how they are transmitted and in some cases cause disease.

Our genomics approach can help us understand how bacteria evade current vaccine strategies to cause disease and how these differences can be exploited to track the spread of pathogens thus aiding the surveillance effort to medical, scientific and public health efforts to tackle these diseases.

## RESEARCH AREAS (Christine - Ste to refine)

Infectious disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in children under five [UN-IGME report 2019](https://childmortality.org/reports). ...The advent of large-scale genomic sequencing technology, open access data and increasing collaborations worldwide has enabled  research scientists to tackle the problem of infectious disease from a global standpoint. ... Through various projects, we aim to understand the evolution of bacteria associated with respiratory infections in a global context. In particular are those whose major disease burden are in resource-poor settings. By understanding how genetics contributes to the survival and spread of disease causing bacteria, we can provide possible solutions to curtail the advancement of these bacteria that continue to evade human interventions such as vaccines and antibiotics.

Our key species of  interest include:
(Please write a 3-5 line brief overview of the named projects)

### Streptococcus pneumoniae (Steph)
[GPS](https://www.pneumogen.net/)
The Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) project produced the largest database of pneumococcal genomes and successfully demonstrated the importance of genomic surveillance by detecting key pneumococcal strains that evade vaccine and antibiotics on national and international level. In the GPS 2.0, we will extend the temporal coverage to characterise the post vaccine equilibrated population so as to inform future vaccine design, and span the geographical coverage to investigate the pneumococcal population in regions with high burden of pneumococcal diseases. To establish a working system for sustainable genomic surveillance, providing bioinformatic training to our project partners, capacity building in priority countries and engaging policy makers are also our key activities in the GPS2.0.

### Neisseria meningitidis (Neil)


### Streptococcus agalactiae (Dorota)

## Our Software

[FastBaps](https://github.com/gtonkinhill/fastbaps)
The fast BAPS algorithm is based on applying the hierarchical Bayesian clustering (BHC) algorithm of (Heller and Ghahramani 2005) to the problem of clustering genetic sequences using the same likelihood as BAPS (Cheng et al. 2013).

[Panaroo](https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo)
An updated pipeline for pangenome investigation.

[Pairsnp](https://github.com/gtonkinhill/pairsnp)
A set of scripts for very quickly obtaining pairwise SNP distance matrices from multiple sequence alignments using sparse matrix libraries to improve performance.
