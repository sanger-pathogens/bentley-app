*Streptococcus pneumoniae* naturally colonises the nasopharynx of healthy individuals but can cause serious invasive diseases such as bacteremia and meningitis and is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia. Through the [Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project](https://www.pneumogen.net/) we have worked with partners from >50 countries to a develop a database of >25,000 genomes representing pneumococcal populations in >60 countries before and after the global rollout of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Data from GPS is being used to identify future high-risk strains and to design future vaccine formulations that will reduce the burden of disease and antibiotic resistance. Through collaborations with [Paul Turner](https://www.tropmedres.ac/team/paul-turner) and colleagues in South East Asia and [Felix Dube](http://www.mcb.uct.ac.za/mcb/people/staff/academic/felix-dube) and colleagues in South Africa we are using genomics to study microevolution during carriage and transmission in densely sampled human populations. We hope these studies will uncover the selective processes at play, particularly during disease episodes and antibiotic treatment.
