        "description": "Fastbaps is a fast solution to the genetic clustering problem. It rapidly identifies an approximate fit to a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPM) for clustering multilocus genotype data. Our efficient model-based clustering approach is able to cluster datasets 10â€“100 times larger including over 110,000 sequences of HIV-1 pol genes."
