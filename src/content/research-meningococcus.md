*Neisseria meningitidis* is found exclusively in humans and is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia. Meningococcal infections are difficult to treat and have a high case fatality rate but, as with the pneumococcus, colonisation is normally asymptomatic. The meningococcus has a substantial disease burden in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, where the incidence of infection and disease are much higher than other regions of the world. We work with numerous collaborators to study several population genomic datasets of *N. meningitidis* including a large carriage collection from [Burkina Faso](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23914778) (with [Dominique Caugant](http://www.menafrinet.org/en-us/Who/Advisory-Board)), the [MenAfriCar](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30301-8/fulltext) meningitis belt carriage surveillance project, and a global collection of carriage and disease isolates with considerable temporal spread. Through these studies we hope to understand the evolution that leads to meningococcal disease epidemics in the Meningitis Belt and help to inform future vaccine intervention strategies worldwide.
