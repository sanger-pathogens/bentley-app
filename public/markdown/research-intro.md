Infectious disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in children under five in low- and middle-income countries*. Large-scale genome sequencing, open access data and increasing collaborative networks are enhancing our ability to tackle the challenges of infectious disease from a global standpoint. Through multiple large-scale projects, we aim to understand the evolution of bacterial pathogens associated with pneumonia, meningitis and neonatal sepsis providing global context with a focus on high disease burden in resource-poor settings.
