*Streptococcus agalactiae* (aka Group B Streptococcus or GBS) is an opportunistic pathogen and a major cause of neonatal invasive disease, with a particular impact on infant mortality in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), where disease prevention strategies are less often implemented or have low coverage. Through the [JUNO](https://www.gbsgen.net/) project are conducting a global genomic survey of GBS isolates from across a broad geographical and temporal span with the central aim of informing vaccine development and other disease intervention strategies. The project will focus on three key areas of GBS biology: global genomic diversity, genetic associations with the disease and transmission.
